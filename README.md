# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To-Do App
This is my first web applicaton, a simple to-do app. 

It was built with React and uses React Router to render different pages. 

## Features it has
This app can add new items, mark them as 'Done' or 'Undone' if necessary, delete those added by mistake, or even clear the whole list with 'Clear all' button. You can save your list to the database and then see all your saved lists on the 'My Lists' page.
